# Privacy Policy for CodePad Extension

## Last Updated: April 11, 2025

## Introduction

Thank you for choosing CodePad ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our CodePad Chrome Extension.

## Information We Collect

### User-Provided Information

- **Code Snippets**: We collect and store the code you write and edit in the CodePad environment. This information is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API.
- **User Preferences**: We collect your configuration settings for the CodePad environment.

### Information Sent to Third Parties

- **API Communication**: When you use features that leverage the Google Generative Language API, your code snippets may be transmitted to Google's servers for processing. This enables features like code completion, error detection, and other AI-assisted programming capabilities.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- Save your code snippets between sessions
- Maintain your preferred settings
- Provide AI-assisted code suggestions and improvements through the Google Generative Language API

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage**: Most of your data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's secure storage API.
- **API Transmissions**: When data is sent to the Google Generative Language API, it is transmitted using secure HTTPS connections.
- **No Collection Server**: We do not operate our own servers to collect or store your data beyond what is stored locally in your browser.

## API Usage Monitoring and Abuse Prevention

While not currently implemented, we reserve the right to:
- Monitor API usage patterns to detect and prevent abuse of the Google Generative Language API
- Collect identifying information (including device information) in cases of suspected API abuse
- Use collected information for blacklisting devices or users found to be violating our terms of service or Google's API terms
- Share information about abuse with Google or relevant authorities when required

Any future implementation of these measures will be reflected in updates to this privacy policy.

## Third-Party Services

Our extension uses Google's Generative Language API. When you use features that require this API, your code snippets are subject to Google's privacy policy and terms of service. We encourage you to review Google's privacy policies at https://policies.google.com/privacy.

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Clear your locally stored data through the extension's interface or browser settings
- Discontinue use of the extension at any time

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Chrome Web Store listing for the extension.
